# wftools
Waveform extraction/processing tools for patient monitoring archive files.

The project consists of the following executables:

- `wfconvert` process patient monitoring archive files, and convert the output to binary format for furtner processing.
- `wfshow` show waveform for quick inspection
- `wfedit` manipulate waveform files (example: select specific channels and combining multiple files, etc.) (coming soon)

It takes configuration in YAML format.  Please check the YAML file in the repository for example.

The output files in .adibin format can be displayed by LabChart's free viewer:

This version has been tested under Python 3.7 on Windows.

v0.4
- Support for BedMaster STP file format (based on STPToolkit v8.2 or later)
- Support for multiple file formats by using attribute ("converter_type", either "bernoulli" or "bedmaster") in YAML config file
- Support for converter specific parameters ("converter_options") in YAML config file
- Support all features, like select channels, up/down sampling, for all converter types
- Fixed renameTo bug if "{endtime}" is used in output filename pattern

v0.3
- Added support for customizable timestamp format in YAML file (option: output_fn_time_format_list)
